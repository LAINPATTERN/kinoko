CDIM
------------------------

## What is CDIM

CDIM is short of **Chinese Declaration of Independence Movement**

This is a movement about Chinese people no longer wanting to be represented by the Chinese Communist Party and expressing disapproval of the crazy things the Chinese Communist Party is doing now.

## Whyï¼Ÿ

We want to realize the freedom of speech, internet freedom, human rights and democracy that are missing in mainland China today.

The fact that the Chinese Communist Party is supporting Russia's war of aggression is also something we oppose.
