## Why upgrading the plug-in system

The current plug-in system is complicated and incomprehensible. 
And interface template is also fragmented from the logic script. 
So I will implment a new plug-in system based on 
[flutter_dapp](https://github.com/gsioteam/flutter_dapp).

The new plug-in system is already be used in my another application 
[KumaV](https://github.com/gsioteam/KumaV), looks it works very well.

PS: The new plug-in system no longer support `ruby` script.
